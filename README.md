# FCC OPIF Notebooks

TV and radio stations provide copies of their political advertising contracts to the FCC. In turn, the FCC provides these documents to the public.

So let's extract and analyze data from these docs.

This repo is a sidecar to [django-fcc-opif](https://github.com/rji-futures-lab/django-fcc-opif) where we can put notebooks in which we inspect and analyze data collected via our Django project.

Our inspiration is ProPublica's [Free the Files](https://www.propublica.org/series/free-the-files) project.
